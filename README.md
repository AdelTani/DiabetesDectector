# Diabetes Risk Prediction Project
by Adel Tani, Albert Seto, Minh Tuyen Ngo

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the risk of diabetes in patients using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis spans data from 130 US hospitals between 1999 and 2008. We evaluate various classification methods, including k Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Feed-Forward Neural Networks implemented with PyTorch.
